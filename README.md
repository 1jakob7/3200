The included source code files can all be compiled and run in Matlab
when the quadtx.m, quadtx2.m, and func2_1.m functions are available 
for reference.

The source code files break down as follows:

1. assign2_1.m

2. assign2_2.m (requires: func2_1.m, quadtx.m, quadtx2.m)

3. assign2_3.m (requires: func2_1.m, quadtx.m)
